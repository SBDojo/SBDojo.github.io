## FAQ

### What is South Brunswick CoderDojo?
South Brunswick CoderDojo (sometimes referred to as SBDojo) is a coding club located in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey. We offer 100% **free** coding workshops to the youth of South Brunswick.

### How does your website work?
We use a static site generator called Jekyll. It takes markdown files (essentially rich text- like a text document without much fancy formatting) and outputs HTML files that format the code for us. The way the code is formatted and stylized is by the use of themes. The theme that we use is [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), using the contrast layout. 

### Why do you upload your files to GitHub?
We use GitHub's static website service, Github Pages, to host our website. The way it works is we upload our website files to a GitHub repository, and they are then processed and uploaded to webservers which display them on [SBDojo.github.io](https://sbdojo.github.io).
