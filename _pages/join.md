Thank you for your interest in becoming a member of the South Brunswick CoderDojo (coding club). 

Our Dojo runs four sessions every school year. Each session is five-weeks long. Enrollment in these sessions is **absolutely free**. During a session, we host one meeting per week where participants (who we call Ninjas) come and engage in our coding-related activities. Our meeting location is the **Smart Lab** in the [South Brunswick Public Library](https://sbpl.info){:target="_blank"}. 

Signups for **Session #1** of the **2021-2022** school year (grades 6-8) are currently open! During this session, Ninjas will learn how to make a python Discord bot, a fully-functioning website, and an interactive text adventure game. 

This session will have workshops every Thursday from 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm, with the first meeting on September 30 and the last on October 28, as shown below:

| Week Number | Date of Meeting    |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Week 1      | September 30, 2021 |
| Week 2      | October 7, 2021    |
| Week 3      | October 14, 2021   |
| Week 4      | October 21, 2021   |
| Week 5      | October 28, 2021   |

This program is **beginner-friendly** but also welcomes advanced Ninjas!

To sign up for the session, parents are to email [teens@sbpl.info](mailto:teens@sbpl.info){:target="_blank"} requesting to enroll their child(ren) in the session. 

There is a member cap of **15 students** for this session, so you should signup ASAP if you want to reserve your spot!

{: .notice--info}
Signing up for our Dojo session means signing up for the entire 5 weeks. Since we have a limited number of spots, we ask that all accepted members commit to **attending each workshop**. If you reserved a spot and would like to pull yourself from the program, please email [teens@sbpl.info](mailto:teens@sbpl.info){:target="_blank"} ASAP.

Once you've signed up, please read [this article](https://sbdojo.gitbook.io/ninjas/attending-a-dojo){:target="_blank"} from our knowledge base to see what you should do to prepare for the first workshop. Most importantly, you will need to **bring your own laptop to every meeting**.
