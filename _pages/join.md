Thank you for your interest in becoming a member of the South Brunswick CoderDojo (coding club). 

Our Dojo runs four, five-week long terms each school year. During a term, we host one meeting per week where participants (who we call Ninjas) come and engage in our coding-related activities. 

To see more information about our classes and instructions on signing up, please go to our [Knowledge Base](https://sbdojo.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/ninjas/sign-up){:target="_blank"}.
