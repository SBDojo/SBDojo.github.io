South Brunswick CoderDojo is a **volunteer** community program that provides **free** out-of-school learning experiences for youth, grades three through eight, to explore programming and its related areas.

Our mission is to empower the next generation to explore programming and other STEAM concepts. We work to create a collaborative, fun, and innovative environment where participants are able to jumpstart their passion for technology.

SB CoderDojo was founded by Rohan Raman, Krish Renjen, and Shriya Guduri in the summer of 2021. View our [Team Profiles](/team/){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} for more information about the team.

SB CoderDojo is an independent chapter of the overall CoderDojo Movement, a volunteer-led community of free programming clubs for young people.
